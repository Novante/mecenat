             <p>I really like to crochet because it makes me calm
                 and I feel less stressed.

             <p>When I start a new crocheting project I usually
                 browse Pinterest or YouTube to see if I find something 
                 that will suit me.

             <p>To start crocheting you'll need some crocheting hooks in 
                 various sizes and yarn. I order my yarn from alot of
                 different websites. 
                 I like to work with cotton and wool yarn.
